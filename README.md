Baked Spaghetti is a quick zesty meat sauce combined with tomatoes and spaghetti and topped with cheese.  This spaghetti casserole is baked in the oven until hot and bubbly.
Just like stuffed shells, this easy recipe is perfect served with  crusty bread, homemade Garlic Butter and a Caesar Salad.
And THAT is what Basic Baked Spaghetti is.
